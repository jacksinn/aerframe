Still have to do everything but let's formalize it a bit

* The images included are from stocksy. Need to change them at some point.

* custom routing - right now everything is based off of package and controller methods

* pretty urls - i thought i did this, look into it

* generate packages command, this will be useful for myself as i build out core packages. might as well eat my own dog food.

* look into creating migrations

* packages should allow for own migrations

* set a standard prefix for package-level migrations to avoid table name conflict

* create an-out-of-the-box cms profile

* profile manifests? make it easy to recreate a project.

* ~~change location of aer console. rather focus on commands right now.~~

* undecided if i want it to be restful and just have front ends or do REST and templating
